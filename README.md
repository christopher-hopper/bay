# About
Bay is a fully managed platform and hosting environment that provides an open Platform as a Service model managed by SDP. It: 
 - is an open-source hosting platform based on Lagoon. 
 - allows agencies to build, test and deliver websites via the cloud.
 - is a Kubernetes-based (OpenShift) Docker container hosting platform with auto-scaling, auto-recovery and high-availability at core.
 - is based on open-source project Lagoon.

## amazee.io Lagoon
Lagoon solves what developers are dreaming about: A system that allows developers to locally develop their code and their services with Docker and run the exact same system in production. The same Docker images, the same service configurations and the same code.
